## About This Project
**User Problems & Pain Points**\
* As a software developer with less than 1 year of experience and a keen interest in Large Language Models(LLMs), prompt engineering and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), I built a chatbot that takes on the persona of 'a software developer with 1 year of experience' to answer questions from my perspective.
* This chatbot uses OpenAI's Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) API to generate responses to user queries.
